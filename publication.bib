This allows us to analyse long-term trends of the international financial integration of the Zagreb Stock Exchange in the last two decades as well as the separate impacts of major events that influenced financial markets during that period. Our results imply a relatively low level of international financial integration of the Croatian stock market, but some convergence in co-movement with the analysed markets over time is present. The strongest market co-movement is related to the subprime mortgage crisis, and EU accession seems to have made Croatian international integration less segmented.},

	abstract = {The goal of the paper is to estimate relative importance of channels of technological diffusion between new member states and core EU countries. Based on neoclassical growth theory and extensive literature survey on technological diffusion we explore movements in the relative TFP in EU member states and try to identify relative importance of channels of technological diffusion as suggested by theory: imports, exports, FDI, R\&D, human capital and fixed capital formation, etc. In the first step we employ Phillips and Sul (2007) log t test which has power to detect convergence even in the absence of cointegration between time series. In the second part we employ Abrigo and Love (2016) PVAR model in order to detect channels of diffusion of technology. The data is sampled from Eurostat and PWT repository and covers the period from 1995-2016 for panel analysis and 1950-2014 for TFP convergence analysis. Our results indicate that in the overall sample FDI and R\&D are major drivers of technological change, while, contrary to conventional wisdom, trade openness and human capital are dominant channels for TFP diffusion in periphery countries. The overall results point that productivity gap reduction is a heterogeneous process, country specific problem, but on average in the periphery it can be supported through various economic policies focused on openness and human capital.},

This paper analyses the response of firms to the economic crisis in the sample of Croatian firms. Our main variables of interest are investment and employment. We estimated the OLS model that accounts for a heterogeneous response to the crisis shock of differently leveraged firms. The empirical model is augmented so that it accounts for industry and county effects. The robustness checks are performed for different dependent as well as control variables and interactions. The results strongly and robustly confirm the importance of the firm’s balance sheet channel.},

	abstract = {This paper provides an analysis of absolute economic convergence among the group of ten new member states (NMS-10) that entered European Union in the year 2004. Convergence dynamics is estimated for the period from 1997 to 2012 as well as for two sub-periods: 1997-2007 and 2007-2012. The analysis covers aspects of sigma- (σ-) and beta- (β-) convergence. Convergence is first estimated by testing for panel unit root in GDP per capita series and then by using standard cross-section equations for absolute convergence. Different time intervals were used so that the analysis could capture the impact of the global economic crisis on long-term convergence performance among the NMS-10 countries. Our results show that this group of countries formed one homogenous convergence club during the entire observed period and achieved high convergence rates in the period before the crisis, while the level of homogeneity in the NMS-10 convergence club was significantly diminished in the period after beginning of the crisis.},

	volume = {66},
	abstract = {We analyze various aspects of the "sense of place" concept in the littoral municipality of Okrug on the island of Čiovo near Trogir. The basis of our research is the difference in perceptions between permanent and temporary residents upon which we draw conclusions and policy implications. The research is embedded into a wider literature and policy discussion on ecosystem services, second homes and counter-urbanization process in Croatia in particular. Our results show that the "sense of place" construct consists of multiple sub-concepts, which, in turn, have multiple factors. Also, the difference in perception of various sub-concepts of the "sense of place" between permanent and temporary residents has been found. The research confirmed the differences in place attachment and place dependence between permanent and temporary residents. Furthermore, a statistically significant difference in the numbers of second-home owners, who rate themselves as natives and newcomers has been confirmed thus suggesting that place rootedness sub-concept may influence the perception of the "sense of place". The overall results have implications for theoretical debate on the "sense of place" and inform range of domestic policy makers in spatial planning, tourism and regional development.},

We believe that this is important because the time dimension of the available data for these countries happens to be too short for the time series analysis. Somewhat short time series that we start from also constrain our results to a certain degree but we are still able to produce the data set that is big enough to satisfy asymptotic properties of some time series estimators and enables the time series analysis on the GDP series in the given sample of countries. We use Chow-Lin (1971) and Fernandez (1981) approaches as well as the Denton (1970) method. We use monthly industrial production index as the indicator variable. Our robustness check includes unit root and cointegration tests on time series we analyse.},
